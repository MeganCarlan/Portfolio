        <p>
            Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.

            Here are a few technologies I have been working with recently:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>Type Script</li>
            <li>MYSQL</li>
            <li>WordPress</li>
        </ul>
        <img src={require("/Users/mcarlan/Desktop/repos/portfolio/src/assets/headshot.png")} alt="My Image" />

    </div>
